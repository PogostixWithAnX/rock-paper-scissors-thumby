# rock-paper-scissors-thumby
My very first (real) Python project. Simple Rock/Paper/Scissors game for the Thumby from Tiny Circuits. Probably a bit of a mess (how many if's can we nest, LET'S FIND OUT!), and there's absolutely some flagrantly stupid workarounds. But I'm still pretty proud of this dumb thing.
Started as a very basid text-based game in PyCharm, then scooted it over to the Thumby editor to get it working there and add sprites n stuff.
Sort of a WIP, I'd like to make the sprites and title screen more dynamic. Eventually I'd also like to add sound. Once it's a little less crude I'll put it on the Arcade. (Might also make a German translation at some point since I need to practice my German more... Ich bin eine Banane.)
Made the sprites myself in CSP (it was just the art program I'm comfortable with).
If you've got any feedback, let me know! Judge me kindly please, I cry easy ;w; 
There's a few silly secrets, if you're willing to poke around in the code. Or just mash all the buttons.
That's about all I have to say! Enjoy!
